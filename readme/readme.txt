Plugin for CudaText.
Gives 2 commands: 
- Convert JSON to YAML (it requires 'JSON' as active lexer)
- Convert YAML to JSON (it requires 'YAML' as active lexer)

Plugin handles the entire document (it cannot handle only selection yet)
and outputs the resulting text to a new editor-tab.

It was somehow ported from Sublime Text plugin:
